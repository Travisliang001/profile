  Greetings! I am Travis, a Software Developer based in the sunny city of Los Angeles, CA. I have a relentless passion for learning new technology and leveraging it to solve complex problems. I am constantly seeking to expand my skill set and thrive on collaborating with like-minded individuals on creative projects. In addition to my software expertise, I also have a green thumb for gardening and a knack for making mouth-watering sushi! Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
